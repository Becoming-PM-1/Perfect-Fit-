# Perfect-Fit- overview
Perfect fit is a digital sizing critic that offers personalized fit intelligent to e-commerce by transforming generic size chart into validated scores.  It uses a buyer's unique body profile to predict how a garment's design and cut will fit, eliminating guess work that could causes high return rates and loss of customers.
## problem statement 
one of the greatest source of friction in online fashion retail is Sizing. Generic size charts fail to account for the unique subtleties of a buyer's body geometry (e.g., shoulder slope, waist-to-hip ratio).
